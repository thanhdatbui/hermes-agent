# Pre-Commit Code Verification

Automated verification pipeline before code lands. Static scans, baseline-aware
quality gates, an independent reviewer subagent, and an auto-fix loop.

**Core principle:** No agent should verify its own work. Fresh context finds what you miss.

## Anti-Minefield Review Gate

Reject the change when any of these is present or unverifiable:

1. **Zero silent failures:** swallowed exceptions, `except: pass`, or error handling without useful context.
2. **Bounded execution violation:** I/O, subprocess, HTTP, socket, ADB, or OCR without an explicit timeout and bounded retry policy.
3. **Unsafe rerun:** no receipt/lock/checkpoint/idempotency guard for a repeatable side effect.
4. **Unknown-state continuation:** an unrecognized state is handled by guessing instead of evidence capture and fail-closed stop.

The review result must be internally consistent: `APPROVED` means zero blocking findings; `REJECT` means at least one concrete finding is listed.

## When to Use

- After implementing a feature or bug fix, before `git commit` or `git push`
- When user says "commit", "push", "ship", "done", "verify", or "review before merge"
- After completing a task with 2+ file edits in a git repo
- After each task in subagent-driven-development (the two-stage review)

**Skip for:** documentation-only changes, pure config tweaks, or when user says "skip verification".

**This skill vs github-code-review:** This skill verifies YOUR changes before committing.
`github-code-review` reviews OTHER people's PRs on GitHub with inline comments.

## Step 1 — Get the diff

```bash
git diff --cached
```

If empty, try `git diff` then `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD`.

If `git diff --cached` is empty but `git diff` shows changes, tell the user to
`git add <files>` first. If still empty, run `git status` — nothing to verify.

If the diff exceeds 15,000 characters, split by file:
```bash
git diff --name-only
git diff HEAD -- specific_file.py
```

## Step 2 — Static security scan

Scan added lines only. Any match is a security concern fed into Step 5.

```bash
# Hardcoded secrets
git diff --cached | grep "^+" | grep -iE "(api_key|secret|password|token|passwd)\s*=\s*['\"][^'\"]{6,}['\"]"

# Shell injection
git diff --cached | grep "^+" | grep -E "os\.system\(|subprocess.*shell=True"

# Dangerous eval/exec
git diff --cached | grep "^+" | grep -E "\beval\(|\bexec\("

# Unsafe deserialization
git diff --cached | grep "^+" | grep -E "pickle\.loads?\("

# SQL injection (string formatting in queries)
git diff --cached | grep "^+" | grep -E "execute\(f\"|\.format\(.*SELECT|\.format\(.*INSERT"
```

## Step 3 — Baseline tests and linting

Detect the project language and run the appropriate tools. Capture the failure
count BEFORE your changes as **baseline_failures** (stash changes, run, pop).
Only NEW failures introduced by your changes block the commit.

**Test frameworks** (auto-detect by project files):
```bash
# Python (pytest)
python -m pytest --tb=no -q 2>&1 | tail -5

# Node (npm test)
npm test -- --passWithNoTests 2>&1 | tail -5

# Rust
cargo test 2>&1 | tail -5

# Go
go test ./... 2>&1 | tail -5
```

**Linting and type checking** (run only if installed):
```bash
# Python
which ruff && ruff check . 2>&1 | tail -10
which mypy && mypy . --ignore-missing-imports 2>&1 | tail -10

# Node
which npx && npx eslint . 2>&1 | tail -10
which npx && npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | tail -10

# Rust
cargo clippy -- -D warnings 2>&1 | tail -10

# Go
which go && go vet ./... 2>&1 | tail -10
```

**Baseline comparison:** If baseline was clean and your changes introduce failures,
that's a regression. If baseline already had failures, only count NEW ones.

## Step 4 — Self-review checklist

Quick scan before dispatching the reviewer:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials
- [ ] Input validation on user-provided data
- [ ] SQL queries use parameterized statements
- [ ] File operations validate paths (no traversal)
- [ ] External calls have error handling (try/catch)
- [ ] No debug print/console.log left behind
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] New code has tests (if test suite exists)

## Step 5 — Independent Reviewer (9Router HTTP API - Model `plan-review`)

CẤM dùng `delegate_task` cho việc review/audit (vì `delegate_task` bị gán cứng vào worker model). Mọi tác vụ Code Review / Audit BẮT BUỘC phải gọi trực tiếp qua 9Router HTTP API với model `plan-review` (combo `gpt-5.6-terra → ag/claude-opus-4-6-thinking → deepseek-v4-pro`) hoặc `plan-review-hard` (combo `gpt-5.6-sol → v98/claude-opus-5`).

Call 9Router HTTP API:
- Endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:20128/v1/chat/completions`
- Header: `Authorization: Bearer $NINEROUTER_API_KEY`, `Content-Type: application/json`
- Options bắt buộc: `"stream": false`, `"tools": []`, `"tool_choice": "none"`
- Model: `"plan-review"` (thường) hoặc `"plan-review-hard"` (khó/core)

Python runner mẫu:
```python
import urllib.request, json, os

key = os.environ.get("NINEROUTER_API_KEY")
url = "http://127.0.0.1:20128/v1/chat/completions"
diff_text = """[INSERT GIT DIFF]"""

payload = {
    "model": "plan-review",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are an independent code reviewer. Review the git diff and return ONLY valid JSON with keys: passed (bool), security_concerns (list), logic_errors (list), suggestions (list), summary (str)."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"Review this git diff:\n\n{diff_text}"
        }
    ],
    "stream": False,
    "tools": [],
    "tool_choice": "none"
}

req = urllib.request.Request(
    url,
    data=json.dumps(payload).encode("utf-8"),
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {key}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}
)

with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as resp:
    res = json.loads(resp.read())
    verdict = res["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
```

## Step 6 — Evaluate results

Combine results from Steps 2, 3, and 5.

**All passed:** Proceed to Step 8 (commit).

**Any failures:** Report what failed, then proceed to Step 7 (auto-fix).

```
VERIFICATION FAILED

Security issues: [list from static scan + reviewer]
Logic errors: [list from reviewer]
Regressions: [new test failures vs baseline]
New lint errors: [details]
Suggestions (non-blocking): [list]
```

## Step 7 — Auto-fix loop

**Maximum 2 fix-and-reverify cycles.**

Spawn a THIRD agent context — not you (the implementer), not the reviewer.
It fixes ONLY the reported issues:

```python
delegate_task(
    goal="""You are a code fix agent. Fix ONLY the specific issues listed below.
Do NOT refactor, rename, or change anything else. Do NOT add features.

Issues to fix:
---
[INSERT security_concerns AND logic_errors FROM REVIEWER]
---

Current diff for context:
---
[INSERT GIT DIFF]
---

Fix each issue precisely. Describe what you changed and why.""",
    context="Fix only the reported issues. Do not change anything else.",
    toolsets=["terminal", "file"]
)
```

After the fix agent completes, re-run Steps 1-6 (full verification cycle).
- Passed: proceed to Step 8
- Failed and attempts < 2: repeat Step 7
- Failed after 2 attempts: escalate to user with the remaining issues and
  suggest `git stash` or `git reset` to undo

## Step 8 — Commit

If verification passed:

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "[verified] <description>"
```

The `[verified]` prefix indicates an independent reviewer approved this change.

## Reference: Common Patterns to Flag

### Python
```python
# Bad: SQL injection
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")
# Good: parameterized
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", (user_id,))

# Bad: shell injection
os.system(f"ls {user_input}")
# Good: safe subprocess
subprocess.run(["ls", user_input], check=True)
```

### JavaScript
```javascript
// Bad: XSS
element.innerHTML = userInput;
// Good: safe
element.textContent = userInput;
```

## Integration with Other Skills

**subagent-driven-development:** Run this after EACH task as the quality gate.
The two-stage review (spec compliance + code quality) uses this pipeline.

**test-driven-development:** This pipeline verifies TDD discipline was followed —
tests exist, tests pass, no regressions.

**plan:** Validates implementation matches the plan requirements.

## Pitfalls

- **Empty diff** — check `git status`, tell user nothing to verify
- **Not a git repo** — skip and tell user
- **Large diff (>15k chars)** — split by file, review each separately
- **delegate_task returns non-JSON** — retry once with stricter prompt, then treat as FAIL
- **False positives** — if reviewer flags something intentional, note it in fix prompt
- **No test framework found** — skip regression check, reviewer verdict still runs
- **Lint tools not installed** — skip that check silently, don't fail
- **Auto-fix introduces new issues** — counts as a new failure, cycle continues
